            I am a student at <strong>Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore</strong> currently pursuing BTech in the field of <b>Computer Science 
            with Data Science</b> as a specialisation. I have also been curious about coding and my journey as a student is all about exploring and learning as 
            much as I can. Whether it is in classroom or outside world I enjoy discovering new ideas and pushing myself to grow further.

            My hometown is <em>Uttarakhand</em>, although I was born and bought up in <em>Gurugram, Haryana</em>. I have always been a mountain girl. 
            The fresh air, snow and open sky makes me like it even more. When I'm not studying, you will often find me watching K-dramas, reading a fictional book. I also enjoy playing sports 
            and video games which helps me unwind and stay creative. I also went to play Handball at state level. Being an intorvert, I love spending time 
            with my close friends and family and try out new things that expand my perspective on the world.

            Looking ahead, I hope to contribute more to the society by being a good human being and also a proud daughter to my parents. I believe in the <b>power
            of manifestation</b>. Anything that you speak out loud, will happen if you are ready to thrive for it. I am excited to see where this journey of my 
            life takes me to. Thank you for taking the time to get to know me. Reach out to me if you want to be friends and let's grown together and 
            learn from each other.
