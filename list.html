    <h2>Reviews of My Favorite Movies, Books and Dramas</h2>
    <dl>
        <dt>Movie: 3 Idiots</dt>
        <dd>
            It is my favorite movie because it inspires me to follow my dreams, value true friendship, and reminds me that life is about more than just success.
            It was also one of the reasons I chose engineering.

        <dt>Book: Power of Positive Thinking</dt>
        <dd>
            It helps me stay hopeful and confident in tough times. It inspires me to focus on the good and believe in myself.

        <dt>Drama: Cheese In Trap</dt>
        <dd>
            "Cheese in the Trap" is one of my favorite K-dramas because of its unique story about complicated relationships and hidden emotions.
            The characters feel real, especially the mysterious and reserved Yoo Jung, who keeps you guessing. Itâ€™s a mix of romance, suspense, and drama 
            that kept me hooked till the end.
